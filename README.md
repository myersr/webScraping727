### Requirements and Installation
Most packages will be installed via `requirements.txt`. Newspaper requires some additional system packages and installation is covered [here](http://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/install.html)  
It is a good idea to install everythin within a virtual evironment. [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) is easy to use.  
After installing the needed packages with apt and activating your virtual environment run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
